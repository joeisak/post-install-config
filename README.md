First, I configured the role of an administrator "supreme admin".
I went to the Admin Panel, then Agents, Roles, and assigned roles to the admin.

Next, I allowed anyone to create tickets as long as they were registered users. I did this by going to Admin Panel, Settings, User Settings. There's a box to check that would require user registration to create a ticket.
